Game:
We are planning to build a 2 player chess game that allows 2 players to play a single chess game from 2 different systems. The players will be able to reopen and continue the game even if their session is closed. By doing so a player can be a part of multiple games and in order to play the particular game, the player must enter the game room in which he/she is a part. This game of Chess will supoprt all the current rules of chess game like castling, enpassant and pawn promotion.

Game Rules:
This game of Chess follows all the basic rules that are followed in Chess. No new rules or any changes to the existing rules are made in this game. The rules of this can be found at : http://www.chesscoachonline.com/chess-articles/chess-rules.

Added Functionalities:
Some new features that we are planning to provide are the option for users to watch and spectate the game. By doing so multiple people will be a part of the same chat room but only 2 players will be a part of the game. Another feature that we are planning to provide is the option to live chat. In this feature, any people part of the game will be able to view and chat via the live chat option.

Challenges:
A few challenges that we are expecting is the incorporation of the game rules. Chess has a lot of rules and the game engine must work in such a way that it does not allow any wrong or disallowed moves and at the same time keep a tab on the entire board so that it can give the status to the players such as "Check" or "Check-Mate". Another difficulty that we forsee is handling of game rooms. In order to make sure that only the players playing the game have access and make a move, we must have some authentication such that no other player can enter the game room and resume the current game.
